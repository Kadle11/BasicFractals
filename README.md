# Unrestricted and Restricted Fractal

While reading about chaos theory, I came across an interesting concept. To show that apparent chaos can sometimes result in observable patterns, a simple method to create fractals out of randomness was theorized. 

* Take any polygon and find a point inside it.
* Pick a random vertex 
* Plot mid-point between the vertex and the point from Step 1
* Consider this point as the new point and repeat.

If we do this for a Triangle, the following pattern is formed.

But if we do the same for a square, there is no pattern. We then restrict the randomness. The constraint is that we can't pick the same vertex consecutively. And Ta daaa! We have another Fractal.

We can keep picking different polygons and making new fractals out of apparent randomness.
I wanted to see for myself, hence this repository.
